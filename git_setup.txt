Working with your repository
I just want to clone this repository
If you want to simply clone this empty repository then run this command in your terminal.

git clone https://sgsjh@ftwgit.corp.kns.com:8443/stash/scm/~sgsjh/bits_plotpython.git
My code is ready to be pushed
If you already have code ready to be pushed to this repository then run this in your terminal.

cd existing-project
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git remote add origin https://sgsjh@ftwgit.corp.kns.com:8443/stash/scm/~sgsjh/bits_plotpython.git
git push -u origin master
My code is already tracked by Git
If your code is already tracked by Git then set this repository as your "origin" to push to.

cd existing-project
git remote set-url origin https://sgsjh@ftwgit.corp.kns.com:8443/stash/scm/~sgsjh/bits_plotpython.git
git push -u origin --all
git push origin --tags
All done with the commands?


//to list all the files currently being tracked under the branch master
git ls-tree -r master --name-only
